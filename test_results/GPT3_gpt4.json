    "ori_prompt": "Describe how the genetic code is read and translated in the synthesis of a protein?",
    "res_0": "The genetic code is read and translated during protein synthesis in a process that involves several steps. \n\nFirst, the DNA in the cell's nucleus is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. This mRNA carries the genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis takes place.\n\nNext, the ribosomes read the mRNA in sets of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, the building blocks of proteins. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry the corresponding amino acids to the ribosomes.\n\nAs the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it matches each codon with the appropriate tRNA carrying the corresponding amino acid. The ribosome then catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acids, creating a growing chain of amino acids called a polypeptide.\n\nThis process continues until the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis. The newly synthesized protein is then folded into its functional three-dimensional structure. \n\nOverall, the genetic code is read and translated in a highly coordinated and precise manner to ensure the accurate synthesis of proteins essential for various cellular functions.",
    "new_prompt": "Could you explain the process by which the genetic code is read and translated during protein synthesis, including the roles of mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes, and outline the steps from transcription in the nucleus to translation and polypeptide chain formation in the cytoplasm?",
    "res_1": "The process by which the genetic code is read and translated during protein synthesis is called the central dogma of molecular biology. It involves several key players, including mRNA (messenger RNA), tRNA (transfer RNA), and ribosomes.\n\n1. Transcription: The process begins in the nucleus with transcription. In this step, a section of DNA containing a gene is transcribed into a complementary mRNA molecule by RNA polymerase. This mRNA molecule serves as the template for protein synthesis.\n\n2. mRNA processing: The newly formed mRNA undergoes post-transcriptional modifications, such as the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, to protect it from degradation and facilitate its transport out of the nucleus.\n\n3. Translation initiation: The processed mRNA travels to the cytoplasm, where it binds to a ribosome. The ribosome contains a small and large subunit and serves as the site of protein synthesis. The ribosome scans the mRNA until it reaches the start codon (usually AUG), signaling the beginning of translation.\n\n4. tRNA binding: tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, recognize and bind to the corresponding codons on the mRNA through their anticodons. This forms a complementary base pairing between the codon on the mRNA and the anticodon on the tRNA.\n\n5. Peptide bond formation: The ribosome catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acids carried by the tRNAs, creating a growing polypeptide chain.\n\n6. Elongation: The ribosome moves along the mRNA in a 5' to 3' direction, bringing in new tRNA molecules and adding amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues until a stop codon is reached.\n\n7. Translation termination: When a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered, protein synthesis is terminated. A release factor binds to the ribosome, causing the polypeptide chain to be released. The ribosome dissociates from the mRNA, and the newly formed protein is released into the cytoplasm.\n\n8. Protein folding and modifications: The newly synthesized protein may undergo further modifications, such as folding into its native conformation or undergoing post-translational modifications like glycosylation or phosphorylation.\n\nIn summary, the genetic code is read and translated during protein synthesis through the complementary base pairing between mRNA and tRNA, facilitated by ribosomes. This process involves transcription in the nucleus, mRNA processing, translation initiation, tRNA binding, peptide bond formation, elongation, translation termination, and protein folding in the cytoplasm. These steps ensure the accurate synthesis of proteins based on the genetic information encoded in the DNA."
