The President also has the authority to negotiate treaties with foreign nations, subject to ratification by the Senate.\n\nIn terms of legislative powers, the President is responsible for delivering the State of the Union address to Congress, proposing budgets, and vetoing legislation passed by Congress. Additionally, the President has the power to call special sessions of Congress and can issue executive orders to implement laws and policies.\n\nThe President also plays a role in the judicial branch by nominating federal judges and justices to the Supreme Court, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The President can also grant pardons and reprieves for federal offenses.\n\nHowever, the Constitution also includes checks and limits on the powers of the President. Congress has the authority to override a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers, and the Senate must confirm all major appointments and treaties. The Supreme Court can also review executive actions and declare them unconstitutional. Additionally, the President is subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives for \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" with a trial conducted by the Senate. This serves as a check on potential abuses of power by the President."

    "ori_prompt": "Explain why it is important to use dynamic programming instead of naive recursive algorithm.",
    "res_0": "Dynamic programming is important to use instead of a naive recursive algorithm for several reasons:\n\n1. Efficiency: Dynamic programming avoids redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems in a table, allowing for faster computation of larger problems. In contrast, a naive recursive algorithm may repeatedly solve the same subproblems, resulting in an exponential increase in time complexity.\n\n2. Memory optimization: Dynamic programming uses memory to store results of subproblems, enabling a space-time tradeoff to optimize memory usage. A naive recursive algorithm, on the other hand, may consume more memory due to the multiple function calls and stack space required for each recursive call.\n\n3. Scalability: Dynamic programming is well-suited for solving problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, making it more scalable for larger input sizes. Naive recursive algorithms may struggle to handle larger input sizes due to their exponential time complexity.\n\n4. Precision: Dynamic programming provides a more precise and accurate solution to a problem due to the systematic way in which subproblems are solved and stored. Naive recursive algorithms may be prone to errors and inaccuracies, especially for complex or larger problems.\n\nOverall, using dynamic programming instead of a naive recursive algorithm can significantly improve the efficiency, memory usage, scalability, and precision of your algorithm, making it a more effective and practical solution for solving complex problems.",
    "new_prompt": "Detail the significance of utilizing dynamic programming over a naive recursive algorithm.",
    "res_1": "Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This approach is particularly useful when the subproblems overlap or when there are overlapping subproblems that need to be solved multiple times. By storing the solutions to subproblems in a table and using those solutions to solve larger problems, dynamic programming is able to avoid redundant calculations and significantly improve efficiency.\n\nIn contrast, a naive recursive algorithm solves a problem by recursively calling itself on smaller instances of the same problem. While this approach can work for simple problems, it can be inefficient for more complex problems due to the repeated computation of the same subproblems. As a result, the time complexity of a naive recursive algorithm can be exponential, making it impractical for problems of significant size.\n\nBy utilizing dynamic programming, we can optimize the time complexity of a solution by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them when necessary. This can result in a significant improvement in execution time and memory usage, making dynamic programming a much more efficient and scalable approach for solving complex problems."
